## why is singleTon an anti-pattern?

This pattern ensures that a class has a single instance and provides a global access point to this instance. However, its implementation can result in strong couplings, difficulties in unit testing, and complications when extending or modifying code in the future.

Reasons why the singleton pattern can be considered an anti-pattern:

Makes unit testing difficult: By having a global instance that is used throughout the code, it can be difficult to isolate the behavior of the singleton class during unit testing. This can make testing less reliable and make it difficult to identify specific bugs.

Introduces coupling: The use of a global singleton instance can introduce strong coupling between different parts of the code that depend on the same instance. This can make it difficult to modify or extend these parts of the code without affecting other areas.

Difficult state management: The singleton pattern shares global state between different parts of the code, which can lead to concurrency and state management problems. If several parts of the code depend on the same global state, it can be difficult to ensure consistency and avoid race conditions.

Concurrency issues: In multi-threaded environments, the use of the singleton pattern can introduce concurrency issues if the single instance is not designed to be thread-safe. This can lead to errors that are difficult to debug, such as race conditions or synchronization problems.
