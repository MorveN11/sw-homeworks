## factory Pattrer Dessign

It is a class or method whose main purpose is to create instances of other objects. This can be done in several ways, using different design patterns such as Factory Method, Abstract Factory, or Simple Factory.

## Factory Method: 
Defines an interface to create an object, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. In other words, it delegates object creation to subclasses.

## Abstract Factory: 
Provides an interface to create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. This means that it provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes.

## Simple Factory: 
This is a creative design pattern that is not officially recognized as a design pattern per se. Rather, it is a simplified approach to object creation where you have a single factory that creates various types of objects based on a provided parameter.
