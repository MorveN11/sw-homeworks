# Builder Report

## What I learned?

I learned about the Builder design pattern and its significance in constructing
complex objects step by step, especially useful when dealing with objects
requiring extensive configuration. The pattern helps in avoiding the
"telescoping constructor" issue and allows for the creation of different
representations of a product using the same construction code. Additionally, I
gained insights into the role of the Director class in orchestrating the
construction process and the flexibility it offers in creating various product
configurations.

In summary, the Builder pattern is ideal for constructing complex objects with
multiple configuration options, addressing issues like constructor overload and
enabling the creation of different product representations. It complements other
design patterns like Factory Method and Abstract Factory, providing a structured
approach to object construction while maintaining code flexibility and
modularity.
