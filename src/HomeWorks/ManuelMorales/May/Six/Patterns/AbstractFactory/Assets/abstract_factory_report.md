# Abstract Factory Report

## What I learned?

I learned that the Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that
allows the production of families of related objects without specifying their
concrete classes. It's particularly useful when your code needs to work with
various families of related products, but you want to avoid dependency on the
concrete classes of those products. This pattern provides an interface for
creating objects from each class of the product family, ensuring compatibility
and adherence to the Single Responsibility and Open/Closed Principles.

The pattern involves declaring interfaces for each distinct product, creating an
Abstract Factory interface with a list of creation methods for all products, and
implementing a set of concrete factory classes for each product variant. The
client code works with factories and products only through these abstract
interfaces, allowing for flexibility and extensibility. The Abstract Factory
pattern can be combined with other patterns like Factory Method, Prototype, or
Builder, and can be implemented as Singletons.
