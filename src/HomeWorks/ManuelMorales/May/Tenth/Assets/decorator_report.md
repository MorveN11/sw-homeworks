# Decorator Report

## What I Learned?

I learned about the Decorator design pattern, also known as the Wrapper pattern,
which allows attaching new behaviors to objects by placing them inside special
wrapper objects. This pattern is useful when you need to extend an object's
behavior dynamically at runtime without altering its existing code. It helps in
structuring business logic into layers and composing objects with various
combinations of behaviors. With Decorator, you can easily add or remove
responsibilities from an object, combine multiple behaviors, and follow the
Single Responsibility Principle by dividing functionality into smaller classes.

The Decorator pattern provides flexibility in extending object behavior without
creating new subclasses and allows for runtime customization of object
functionalities. It's particularly useful when inheritance isn't feasible or
when you need to avoid a combinatorial explosion of subclasses. This pattern's
key concept lies in composing objects with additional behaviors via wrapper
objects, maintaining a common interface for client code to interact with these
decorated objects seamlessly.
