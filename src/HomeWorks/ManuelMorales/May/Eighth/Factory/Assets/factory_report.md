# Factory Method Report

## What I Learned?

I learned from the Factory Method design pattern that it provides a flexible way
to create objects by allowing subclasses to determine the specific type of
objects they want to create. This pattern is beneficial for decoupling the code
that creates objects from the code that uses them, which promotes easier
maintenance and extensibility of the application.

It serves me well for scenarios where I need to add new types of objects without
modifying existing code extensively. With the Factory Method pattern, I can
easily introduce new subclasses that override the factory method to produce
different variants of products, adhering to principles like Single
Responsibility and Open/Closed. This pattern enables me to design more modular
and scalable software, where I can create various product types while keeping
the client code unaware of the specific implementations, thus enhancing code
reusability and maintainability.
