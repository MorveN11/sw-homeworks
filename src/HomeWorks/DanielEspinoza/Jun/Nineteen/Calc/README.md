### CALCULATOR PROJECT

This project aims to simulate a Calculator , this calculator will receive a string as input and will return it as int output, if the input is not a number it will return an error. 

The calculator will be able to do basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and exponentiation.


This operations are taking in the proejct string as input and will return an int as output.
    + , - , * , / , ^, sqrt

  
available inputs are:

    1+2
    1-2
    1*2
    1/2
    1^2
    (1)sqrt(4)

the process :

    1+2-2*3

    [*,-,+][3,2,2,1]



the result :
    
    -3
