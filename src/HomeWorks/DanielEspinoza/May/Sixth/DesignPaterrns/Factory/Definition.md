# Factory Design Pattern

Factory Method is like having a magic box that can create different types of objects for you. Instead of directly creating objects using the "new" keyword, you call a special method (the magic box) that knows how to create the right type of object based on your needs. This way, you don't have to worry about the details of how each object is created; you just ask the magic box for what you need, and it delivers it to you.


in summary
the factory method pattern helps us to create objects without having to know exactly what type of object you need beforehand. It's like having a flexible system that can adapt to different requirements without a lot of fuss
