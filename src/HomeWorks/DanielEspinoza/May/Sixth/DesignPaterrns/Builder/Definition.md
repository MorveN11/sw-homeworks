# Builder Design Pattern

The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that enables the construction of complex objects step by step. It allows the creation of different types and representations of an object using the same construction code. This pattern facilitates the construction of objects with varying configurations while keeping the construction process separate from their representation, promoting code reusability and flexibility
